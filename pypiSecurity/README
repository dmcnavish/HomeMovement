pypiSecurity
============

This is the Python side of the security application. This code runs on the Raspberry Pi. 

The Raspberry Pi needs to be connected to a supported web camera and running [http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome](Motion). The config/motion.conf contains the required configuration to handle movement, camera settings and trigger a script whenever motion is detected.

The additional scripts are used to insert data into a MySql database running locally, upload a subset of the data externally to MongoLab, and also upload the videos that motion creates to Google Drive.
